    <p>Nothing quite compares to playing a video game for the first time and getting that feeling of awe as you are immersed in a new world.
        With technology advancing faster than ever and thousands of new games being released every year, it's easy to overlook the games that changed
        us. Wether it was awesome gameplay, cool new mechanics, beautiful landscapes, a gripping story, or a combination of these, gamers often wear
        their favorite games as a badge of honor. With that being said... <br>

    <p><h3>Here are my top 5 video games</h3>
    <ol>

            I awoke in the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center for the first time... and immediately threw both the radio and the coffee cup into the toilet. <br>
            Initially released as part of the Orange Box, most thought Portal was a trial. In reality, it was a phenomena; a physics game masterpiece that changed the world of puzzle games. <br><br>
            But remember, the cake is a lie! Or is it?

            Just when you think perfect can't get any more perfecterer... They made a Portal 2! This game picks up after the events of the first game,
            and re-raises the bar of what puzzle games could be. The story of Chell, Cave Johnson, and Caroline is very easy to miss, but is so deep that you will keep finding yourself wondering for weeks afterward what could have been, or, what actually was...? <br><br>
            Also, they added co-op! After the events of Portal 2, GLaDOS(Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) has now created two new reusable robots for testing. 
            No longer is she burdened with having to find humans to test her experiments!
            You play as ATLAS and P-body in a whole new set of test chambers built for two people, requiring two portal guns for twice the fun!

            In The Witness, you awake in a dark chamber. After opening the door, you find yourself on a beautiful but desserted island. You do not know how you arrived here, but as you explore, you keep finding maze-type puzzle
            panels. Using the tools provided, you progress through the game and learn the many panel mechanics, and slowly unlock pieces of the mystery surrounding this magical place.
